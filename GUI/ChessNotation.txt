Chess Notation:

Each piece type (other than Pawns) is identified by an upper-case letter, usually the first letter of the name of the piece. 
E.g. The letter K for King, Q for Queen, R for Rook, B for Bishop, and N for Knight (since K is already used for the King)

Moving Pieces:

Each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's upper-case letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square. 
For example, Be5 (moves a Bishop to e5), Nf3 (moves a Knight to f3), c5 (move a pawn to c5 no upper-case letter is needed for moving Pawns).

Capturing Pieces:

When a piece makes a capture, an "x" is inserted immediately before the destination square. 
For example, Bxe5 (Bishop captures the piece on e5). 
When a Pawn makes a capture, the square from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn. 
For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-square captures the piece on d5)

Castling:

Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 (for kingside castling) and 0-0-0 (queenside castling).
